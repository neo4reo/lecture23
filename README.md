# First-class Functions

This branch has modifications to pass functions around as values; it has the
code we wrote in class plus:

- The necessary code in the EApp case to handle identifiers-as-functions
- A tweak to the Makefile to avoid some warnings about position-independent
  executables on OSX
- New instructions for jumping to a register value and aligning instruction
  addresses
